  If it's critical to work you'll submit as a paper, please consider engaging us as a co-author. 
  If you make money from it, you need to develop an agreement with Oregon State University and Boston University.

- It probably will break.  Each user finds new ways to do this.  We'll try to help as much as we can, but
  we're not a software company.  
  
- Improve it!   But when you do, please use Git to document your change so others can benefit.  
  If you're doing a lot of this, please contact Robert (rkennedy@coas.oregonstate.edu) so you can become a registered 
  Git user in the lab and make your improvements part of the "sanctioned" main branch.
